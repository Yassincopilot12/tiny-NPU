## 📦 What is tiny-NPU?

tiny-NPU is a free tool that lets you run GPT-2, a well-known language model, on your computer. It works like a mini neural processing unit (NPU) designed specifically for language model inference. This means you can see how GPT-2 generates text without needing a big or complicated setup.

The program is open source, so anyone can use, share, and learn from it.
